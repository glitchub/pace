Usage:

    pace [options] [file]

Write bytes from file or stdin to stdout at a specific pace, defined as
nanoseconds per byte. The default pace is 86805nS per byte to simulate 115,200
baud N-8-1 UART transfer.

Options:

    -b baud     - simulate UART baud rate
    -f          - also delay before the first byte
    -n nS       - nanoseconds per byte, 1 to 999999999
    -v          - report pace to stderr

-b and -n are mutually exclusive. Exits immediately after last byte is sent.
